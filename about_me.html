     <h1>About me</h1>

     <p>What career do you want to have when your older? That question is not as simple as</p>
     <p>you may think, especially for a 14 year old, there is a lot of things I want to be, maybe</p>
     <p>a Professional Athlete, mechanic, or Youtuber. If I am not at school I am playing soccer</p>
     <p>if I am not playing soccer I am playing video games. I pick these careers because I have</p>
     <p>a passion for each one of them. There are many things that inspire me to be one of these</p>
     <p>things, the whole Real Madrid team inspire me to play soccer and one day be as good as </p>
     <p>everyone on the team. Many youtubers have inspired me to become a youtuber by cheering</p>
     <p>me up by just being themselves and getting paid for that. My God father is a mechanic and</p>
     <p>I have always admired and felt inspired by him</p>
     
     <p>One thing about me is, If I really love something I will be there everyday doing it no matter</p>
     <p>what. I love playing soccer; everyday there was practice No matter if I didn't feel like it,<p>
     <p>I was sick, or if it was raining I was there. Same goes for youtube, I would like to be a <p>
     <p>youtuber because would love to put a smile on people's faces just like they have and</p>
     <p>get paid to do. A mechanic is just something I always found interesting and would like to</p>
     <p>learn more about</p>
     
     <p>My favorite soccer team is Real Madrid and I'm A die hard fan and I won't ever change,</p>
     <p>My favorite position in the field is forward and my least favorite is Goalkeeper. My top 3</p>
     <p>favorite games to play with my friends are Rainbow Six Siege, Fortnite, and Call of duty</p>
     <p>WW2. I can sometimes considered to be very competitive but most of the time I just play</p>
     <p>around. </p>
